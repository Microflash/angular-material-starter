## Development

#### Development Server

> `bash` is a prerequisite for this starter to work. On Windows, you can use Git Bash, Cygwin or WSL.

`npm start` launches a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. You can also use `npm run start:hmr` to take advantage of Hot Module Replacement.

#### Build

`npm run build` spawns a production build of the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/angular-material-starter` directory.
